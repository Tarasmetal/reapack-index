### Configuration

Options can be specified from the command line or stored in configuration files.
The syntax is the same as the command line, but with a single option per line.

The settings are applied in the following order:

- ~/.reapack-index.conf (`~` = home directory)
- ./.reapack-index.conf (`.` = repository root)
- command line

## Packaging Documentation

This indexer uses metadata found at the start of the files to generate the
database in ReaPack format.
See also [MetaHeader](https://github.com/cfillion/metaheader)'s documentation.

Tag not explicitly marked as required are optional.

### Package type by extension:

- `.lua`, `.eel`, `.py`: ReaScripts â€“ the package file itself will be used as a source.
- `.ext`: For REAPER native extensions

### Package Tags

These tags affects an entire package. Changes to any of those tags are
applied immediately and may affect released versions.

**@noindex**

Disable indexing for this file. Set this on included files that
should not be distributed alone.

```
@noindex

NoIndex: true
```

**@version** [required]

The current package version.
Value must contain between one and four groups of digits.

```
@version 1.0
@version 1.2pre3

Version: 0.2015.12.25
```

### Version Tags

These tags are specific to a single package version. You may still edit them
after a release by running the indexer with the `--amend` option.

**@author**

```
@author cfillion

Author: Christian Fillion
```

**@changelog**

```
@changelog
  Documented the metadata syntax
  Added support for deleted scripts

Changelog:
  Added an alternate syntax for metadata tags
```

**@provides**

Add additional files to the package. This is also used to add platform restrictions
or set a custom download url (by default the download url is based on the "origin"
git remote).  These files will be installed/updated together with the package.

```
@provides unicode.dat

Provides:
  Images/background.png
  Images/fader_small.png
  Images/fader_big.png

@provides
  [windows] reaper_extension.dll http://mysite.com/download/$version/$path
```

List of supported platform strings:
- `windows`: All versions of Windows
- `win32`: Windows 32-bit
- `win64`: Windows 64-bit
- `darwin`: All versions of OS X
- `darwin32`: OS X 32-bit
- `darwin64`: OS X 64-bit

The following variables will be interpolated if found in the URL:
- `$path`: The path of the file relative to the package
- `$commit`: The hash of the commit being indexed or "master" if unavailable
- `$version`: The version of the package being indexed

Platform restriction and custom url can be set for the package itself,
either by using its file name or a dot:

```
-- this is a lua script named `hello_osx.lua`
-- @provides
--   [darwin] hello_osx.lua

-- @provides
--   [darwin] .
```
